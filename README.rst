Mutt credentials in Gnome keyring
=================================

This is a small script to make Mutt lookup passwords in Gnome keyring, instead
of having those unencrypted in ``~/.muttrc``.

See the comments at the top of the ``mutt-gnome-keyring-password.py`` script for
more information how to configure this.
