Mutt credentials in Gnome keyring
=================================

This is a helper script to make Mutt lookup passwords in Gnome keyring, instead
of having those unencrypted in ``~/.muttrc``. See the comments at the top of the
``mutt-gnome-keyring-password.py`` script for more information on how to use
this script.
